# Logs

This folder contains logging configuration and utilities for the JMDT Geth Facade.

## Purpose

The Logs folder is designed to centralize all logging-related functionality, including:

- **Log Configuration**: Centralized logging setup and configuration
- **Log Utilities**: Helper functions for structured logging
- **Log Formats**: Standardized log output formats
- **Log Levels**: Configurable log levels for different environments

## Current Status

Currently, the project uses Go's standard `log` package with custom formatting. This folder is prepared for future enhancements such as:

- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for better parsing
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log file rotation and cleanup
- **Log Aggregation**: Integration with log aggregation services
- **Performance Logging**: Request/response timing and metrics

## Future Enhancements

- **Zap Integration**: High-performance structured logging
- **Log Levels**: Debug, Info, Warn, Error levels
- **Request Tracing**: Distributed tracing for request flows
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and usage metrics

## Usage

Logs are currently generated throughout the codebase with standardized comments:

- `//debugging`: Debug-related logging statements
- `//future`: Planned logging enhancements
- `//test`: Test-related logging
- `//conversions`: Logging for data type conversions

## Configuration

Logging configuration will be centralized here to allow for:

- Environment-specific log levels
- Output destination configuration (file, stdout, remote)
- Log format customization
- Performance optimization settings
