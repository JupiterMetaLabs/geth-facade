### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

#### Import Path Changes
Due to the folder restructuring, import paths have changed:

**Before:**
```go
import (
    "github.com/jupitermetalabs/geth-facade/backend"
    "github.com/jupitermetalabs/geth-facade/rpc"
    "github.com/jupitermetalabs/geth-facade/pkg/memorybackend"
    "github.com/jupitermetalabs/geth-facade/pkg/jmdtgethfacade"
)
```

**After:**
```go
import (
    "github.com/jupitermetalabs/geth-facade/Types"
    "github.com/jupitermetalabs/geth-facade/Services"
)
```

#### Package Name Changes
- `backend` → `Types`
- `rpc` → `Services`
- `memorybackend` → `Services`
- `jmdtgethfacade` → `Services`

### 📦 Installation

#### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupitermetalabs/jmdt-geth-facade.git
cd jmdt-geth-facade
git checkout v2.0.0
go build -o jmdt-geth-facade
```

#### Using Go Modules
```bash
go get github.com/jupitermetalabs/geth-facade@v2.0.0
```

### 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Basic API tests
./Tests/test-basic.sh

# Comprehensive tests (requires Python)
./Tests/test-apis.sh

# WebSocket tests
./Tests/test-websocket.sh

# CI/CD tests
./Tests/test-ci.sh
```

### 🐳 Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -f Scripts/Dockerfile -t jmdt-geth-facade:v2.0.0 .

# Run container
docker run -p 8545:8545 -p 8546:8546 jmdt-geth-facade:v2.0.0
```

### 📈 Performance

- **HTTP Throughput**: 10,000+ requests/second
- **WebSocket Connections**: 1,000+ concurrent connections
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB baseline
- **Response Time**: < 1ms for cached operations

### 🔮 Future Roadmap

- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting and throttling
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics integration
- **Caching**: Redis-based response caching
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple backend support
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards
